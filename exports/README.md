# Exports

This directory contains automatically generated exports of the radio database.

## Files

- `all.json` - All radio stations in JSON format
- `all.m3u` - All radio stations in M3U playlist format
- `stats.json` - Database statistics
- `by-country/` - Country-specific exports

## Country-Specific Exports

Each country has two files:

- `{COUNTRY}.json` - JSON format (e.g., `CZ.json`)
- `{COUNTRY}.m3u` - M3U playlist format (e.g., `CZ.m3u`)

## Usage

### For RadioStation 3D Integration (Future)

The app would fetch from:
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/fos-fm/main/exports/all.json`

### For Users

Download country-specific M3U playlists:
- Czech Republic: `CZ.m3u`
- Slovakia: `SK.m3u`
- Germany: `DE.m3u`
- etc.

Import these playlists into any music/radio player that supports M3U format.

## Auto-Generation

These files are automatically generated by GitHub Actions when `radios.json` is updated.

**Do not edit files in this directory manually!** Edit `radios.json` instead.
